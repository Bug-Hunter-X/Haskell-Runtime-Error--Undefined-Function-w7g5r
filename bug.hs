This Haskell code attempts to use an undefined function: 
```haskell
undefinedFunction :: Int -> Int
undefinedFunction x = x + 1

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = undefinedFunction 5
  print result
```
This will result in a runtime error because `undefinedFunction` is declared but not defined.  The compiler doesn't catch this because the type signature is valid.
